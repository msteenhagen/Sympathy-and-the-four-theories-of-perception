Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'feel with' others. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. My aim is to bring out how it is all to easy to overlook viable options in the discussions about sympathy. In particular, I want to focus attention on why a 'direct' account of sympathy, one which allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is commonly ruled out _ab initio_.

# Moral sympathy

## History of sympathy

The concept of sympathy, at least in philosophy and science, came first into prominence in Stoic writings. It was not then primarily a psychological notion – at least not one about individual psychology. It entered into cosmological and physical theories to characterise and explain the phenomenon of action at a distance. One of the key examples, discussed throughout ancient, medieval and early-modern theories, is that of one musical instrument’s causing reverberations in another. If I pluck a string of this lute, the strings of the lute standing in the corner may start vibrating as well. How can that be, given that the instruments are not in contact with one another? This was explained by the fact that objects are, or at least can be, in sympathy with one another. 

More sweepingly, the Stoics seem to maintain that the universe or cosmos as such is ‘sympathetic’ in that any existing thing potentially has immediate influence on every thing else. 

Some authors, such as Plotinus, Ockham and, arguably, Aristotle, thought that also visual perception relies on the principles of action at a distance. A distant object is able to affect the character of our experience. The coloured surface of a piece of fruit before my eyes is not in actual contact with any of my perceptual organs, and yet it is able to determine what my experience is like. Plotinus, interestingly, explicitly relied on the concept of sympathy to illuminate such perceptual situations. The distal coloured objects of vision are sympathetic to us in an act of perception, which explains that they are able to determine our experience without being in physical contact. 

Now, in modern philosophy and science, the very idea of action at a distance met with fierce hostility. The theories of harmonics and perception respectively where reformulated in terms of tidy ‘causal chains’ consisting of vibrating air in a medium, or light rays affecting the receptors of the optic nerve to cause in us ‘impressions’ of the objects we perceive. Whereas in the time of Francis Bacon the relation between the two lutes was still considered magical, it can be seen that more reductive physical theories emerge to explain their interaction. Similarly, theories of perception were rephrased in terms of the ‘proximal’ causes that are in contact with our sense organs.

However, we can see that in Hume, who is clearly one of the central figures in the tradition of sympathy, the problem of action at a distance re-emerges. 

Given Hume's theory of impressions, the problem of action at a distance re-emerges in the context of a discussion of our knowledge of other minds. If impressions are subjective effects that are only able to stand in causal relations with other or further impressions within the same mind, then how can I know on the basis of my impressions about the impressions of another person? This is how sympathy as we currently tend to think of it gets introduced (not uniquely by Hume, but around this time and for these reasons). I will refer to it in what follows as our moral sympathetic capacity, or 'moral sympathy' in short.

## Sympathy and other minds

To sympathise with someone, is to be able to feel your way into their mental state. It is often taken to be a crucial element in our mind-reading capacity, and arguably plays a role in our capacity for co-cognition. In other words, often, an answer to how it is that person A knows what person B is going through (if they know this) is found in the fact that person A is able to sympathise with B's feelings. 

Perception can be thought of as a form of awareness. It is awareness by experience, as we could put it. As such, to perceive something is for it to figure in experience. I think that, similarly, sympathy can be thought of as a kind of awareness by experience. It is commonly contrasted often with a mere inferential or theoretical understanding of other people's states: it is a kind of awareness of other people's states that proceeds by means of experience. 

# Understanding perception

In the philosophy of perception, there are several camps, which can be clearly delineated. Taking visual perception of an ordinary object as a test-case, we can ask: When we say that we see a pig, then is a pig the immediate object of awareness? And, is seeing something dependent on the actual presence of the immediate object of awareness? Let me explain how I understand the vexed oppositions I'm using here to carve up logical space: 'immediate/mediate' and 'dependent/independent'

## Mediate and immediate perception

First I will say briefly how I want to think of the difference between mediate and immediate perception. I take a perception to be mediate to the extent it is not immediate. The issue is controversial. My main interest here is to tell apart theories that think that in perceiving something our awareness is somehow 'direct', that there is no mediating object involved. A mediator in perception is an object the perception of which 'counts' as the perception of some other object. Wherever this occurs, perception gets split into two aspects: the immediate awareness of a mediator, and the mediate awareness of whatever more we may be said to perceive. The immediate can occur without any mediate aspect, but the converse does not hold. (Mediators can be either mind-dependent or not.)

## Dependent and independent perceptual awareness

Second, the distinction between awareness that's dependent on its objects, and awareness that isn't. Also this matter is controversial. There are authors who deny that awareness can ever be independent of its object. But others seem to be more permissive (or sloppy, depending how you look at it). This is the key question, I think. Does our awareness depend for its occurrence on the existence of its immediate objects? Think of a case where someone is hallucinating. They maintain that they see a figure in the corner of a room where there is just no such figure. Is this a possible perception? Some say it is not, others say it is. 

## The four theories of perception 

VISION | Independent | Dependent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: Representationalist | B: Naïve realist 
Mediate | C:? | D: Sense-datum

(Arguably, one important line Charles Travis has defended is that, in effect, the position commonly called 'Representationalism' is a version of C. Travis claims C is incoherent as a theory of perception, and also seems to suggest that A is incoherent [cf. @travis2004aa; @travis2013aa, Ch. 1]. The discussion here seems to me to regurgitate elements of the dispute between Malebranche and Arnauld.)

# Understanding moral sympathy

What I want to take seriously here is that sympathy equally can be thought of as a kind of awareness. Plausibly, at least in central cases, we can think of it as an awareness of the feeling of someone else. But how does this work? 


Let us similarly start with a test case. Zeynep is currently sympathising with Boaz, and so we can say that, in some sense, she is aware of Boaz' anxiety, and this is an awareness by experience. (I take anxiety because it is a prevalent, but not too complex state that at least arguably has a distinctive pattern of feelings associated with it.) 

The first thing we can ask is: Is Boaz' anxiety the immediate object of Zeynep's awareness? A negative answer is what underpins most simulation approaches to sympathy. When we sympathise with someone, we simulate their mental state by 'running offline' some of our own mental processes. The result is a feeling of ours that figures as an encapsulated, offline element of our overall mental state. If the answer is yes, on the other hand, then we may say that the traditional way of thinking about sympathy as a capacity to 'feel what others feel' seems very apt.  

Now, to our second question: Is Zeynep's sympathetic state dependent on the actual existence of its immediate object? We should keep in mind that, as we just saw, there will be two opposed views on what these immediate objects are. They are either the 'target' feelings of the other person, or they are something else. Can we experience a feeling of anxiety when there is none? If we think that sympathetic awareness is intentional, then this must be possible. If, on the other hand, we think of it as a dependent awareness, then it cannot be so.

# Perception, moral sympathy, and episodic memory

Before concluding, it is insightful to compare the two schemas we have talked about so far with a third. Let's briefly turn to memory. 

Episodic memory is often thought of as a capacity for being affected by past events. It can be understood as a form of experiential awareness, just as perception and moral sympathy can. 

This is often maintained even by people who think of memory as essentially _reconstructive_. There is a long dispute in the philosophy of memory over the question whether remembering a past event depends on the actual occurrence of that event or not. In a flash I may episodically recall an occasion on which I was bullied in high school. Does my having that memory episode right now depend on the remembered occasion's actually having taken place? 'Dependent' theories of memory claim it does, 'independent' theories deny that. 

As a further question, we may ask whether the episode I undergo now, when I remember the bullying, is the event we claim to remember, or some other event? If it's another event, then again it seems that we're dealing with some kind of go-between or proxy for the event that's the 'target' of the memory. And so again we can see a split between 'mediate' and 'immediate' theories of memory. 

MEMORY | Independent | Dependent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: Time-travelling | B: Reconstruction
Mediate | C: Re-enacting | D: Mental modelling

What is most interesting to observe here is that there is at least a prima facie plausibility to the Independent Mediator views in a way not found in perception. In remembering, we piece together a model of an event that is not actually going on, but merely imagined, and this imagined event stands in and aims to track or represent an earlier event, the event we claim to remember. These views are called naive indirect realists about memory, and face the question: what distinguishes memory from imagination [cf. Lawlor's chapter in @mclaughlin2009aa, p. 663]. On the other hand, the idea that an actual event is experienced, which mediates for a past event (call it the re-enactment view), is puzzling as an account of episodic memory.
