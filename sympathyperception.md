# What if we compare sympathy to perception?
Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'tap into someone else's feelings', to 'feel with them', or to 'feel what they feel'. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. The serious philosophical issue about sympathy I am interested in is that of understanding the basic elements and relations involved in an act of sympathising. And the fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception I'll talk about is precisely about such basic elements and relations, but then how they are involved in our perceptual awareness of our surroundings. 

Comparing sympathy with perception brings out how it is all too easy to overlook viable options. In particular, I want to flag that a naïve, 'direct' account of sympathy that allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is frequently not even considered an available view. 

After some brief remarks about terminology and the history of sympathy, I will apply a framework for thinking about perception to our capacity of sympathy. That's the core of the paper, and I will make some observations about the 'space of possibilities' as it emerges from this comparison. I'll show how a modern conception of psychology fosters the intuition that a naïve account of sympathy somehow assumes we have access to the inaccessible. In that light, I will end by briefly contrasting sympathetic awareness of other people's feelings with our awareness of that other supposedly inaccessible realm, the past as it figures in episodic memory.

# Sympathy is a psychological capacity to 'feel with' others

## With 'sympathy' we do not mean any specific feeling

What I call 'sympathy' is nowadays often called empathy. The labelling doesn't matter. What matters is that by 'sympathy' I don't mean a specific kind of compassionate sentiment, but a general psychological capacity we seem to have: the capacity to become aware of, or in some way experience or live through the mental states or sentiments of others, _whatever these states or sentiments happen to be_. Sympathy is a kind of openness to the mental lives of other people. 

## The concept of sympathy has a long history 

Understanding the history of sympathy sheds important light on which puzzle it is meant to solve in contemporary debates. The concept of sympathy, at least in philosophy and science, came first into prominence in Stoic writings. It was not then primarily a psychological notion, but a concept in physics or cosmology. It was recruited to explain cases of action at a distance. Think of the way the moon influences the tidal flow of our oceans. It does so without their being any contact between the lunar surface and the seas. This phenomena are puzzling. The Stoics inferred that they show that the cosmos is a ‘sympathetic’ unity: any part of the cosmos has the potential to affect every other part without intermediaries. 

Now, to modern ears---ears used to cool mechanism---the very idea of action at a distance will sound funny, contradictory, even. Modern cosmology and physics aspires to explanations that trace series of proximal causes, consisting of vibrating air, molecular chain-reactions, propagating light waves, etc.

But even today philosophy has room for the concept of sympathy. Although it's discredited as an explanatory concept in the natural sciences, sympathy lives on in the 'Science of Man', as English and Scottish enlightenment authors became interested in it. For these authors the problem of action at a distance re-emerged. In some way, we have access to and even seem to be affected by the contents of another individual's mind. How can I know on the basis of my sensations, impressions or ideas about the sensations, impressions or ideas this other person has? Sympathy gets introduced to explain this, and so gets moulded into the psychological shape we're familiar with. This is how I will understand the concept in what follows.

# Sympathy & perception are forms of awareness
To sympathise with someone, is to feel your way into their mental state. It is often taken to be a crucial element in mind-reading, and arguably plays a role in our capacity for concerted agency or thought. So, at least often, an answer to how it is that Zayneb knows what Hisham is going through (if she know this) is found in the fact that Zayneb is able to sympathise with Hisham's feelings.

Sense perception can be thought of as a form of awareness. It is awareness by experience, as we could put it. Perceiving a suspension bridge involves such a bridge making its way into your experience of your surroundings. I think that, similarly, sympathy can be thought of as a kind of awareness by experience. It is commonly contrasted often with a mere inferential or theoretical understanding of other people's states: it is a kind of awareness of other people's states that proceeds by means of experience. 

## Views about perception can be deliniated

There are several ways we can understand what sense perception involves. This makes it that in the philosophy of perception we find a clear delineation of views. Let's focus on vision. Take that suspension bridge again. When you see that bridge, what elements and relations are involved in such an act? There are two important questions we can ask here. 

When you see that bridge, is the immediate object of your visual awareness the bridge, or is it something else, such as an image of the bridge, or the bridge's outer surface, or a visual sensation caused in you? This discussion has a long history.

Second, we may ask whether the immediate awareness we have, whether it is of the bridge or of something else, depends for its occurrence on the actuality or existence of what we're aware of. Could you have this awareness if the thing you become aware of did not exist? Especially in the last decades, philosophers have debated what we should say about this. 

Both these questions are besieged by controversy, but I think that at least the basic distinctions here are straightforward. Let me say a little bit more about each of them.
    
### Mediate and immediate perception are distinct

Think of a painted portrait of a distant relative. Your visual awareness of the portrait enables perceptual access to a person that, at least from where you're now, cannot be perceived immediately. In this way, the portrait may be thought of as a mediator in your visual perception. 

Now, an ordinary case of seeing a suspension bridge doesn't involve awareness of painted portraits, but many authors have suggested that it involves awareness of some other kind of mediator or go-between. One way of understanding Hume's theory of sense impressions is as a view according to which seeing a suspension bridge is constituted by a visual awareness of a subjective, private complex of impressions that enables perceptual access to a bridge that lies beyond it.

So if we ask what the immediate object of visual awareness in perception is, we open up this issue of potential perceptual mediation. Is our perception of the world mediated or not? A mediator in perception is some object of awareness that functions as a proxy or go-between, and that enables perceptual access to things that lie beyond it. 

### Dependent and independent perception are distinct

Does our awareness depend for its occurrence on the existence of its immediate objects? Think of a case where someone is hallucinating. They maintain that they see a figure in the corner of a room where there is just no such figure. Is this a possible perception? Some say it is not, others say it is. 

The second distinction then concerns the immediate awareness that is constitutive of acts of perceiving. We may distinguish between awareness that's dependent on its objects, and awareness that isn't. This distinction has taken central stage in recent discussion in the philosophy of perception.

## This gives us four theories of perception 

Given these distinctions, we end up with four different ways of thinking about what perception involves. Again, I will focus on vision. 

VISION | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | I. Naïve realist | II. Representationalist
Mediate | III. Sense-datum | IV. ?

The __first__ view, naïve realism is arguably the view of common sense. It's the view that we are directly aware of what we report to perceive, and that such awareness cannot occur if there's in fact nothing out there. In such a case we're under the spell of hallucination. The __second__ position is commonly known as 'representationalism' is currently most popular among philosophers, in part under the influence of Descartes. It agrees that we're aware of what we report to perceive, but maintains that this awareness may occur regardless of whether its object is present or exists. The __third__ view is best known through its defence by sense-datum theories, popular until the 1950s. It maintains that in perception we're aware of a mediator or proxy that relays information about the objects in our environment we report to see.

The __fourth__ view is somewhat puzzling. This view agrees with sense-datum theory that perception consists first and foremost of the awareness of a mediator, but it claims that this awareness may occur regardless of whether such a mediator is actually present to the mind. Charles Travis claims C is incoherent as a theory of perception because it cannot explain the basic fact of something's appearing to us [cf. @travis2004aa; @travis2013aa, Ch. 1].

# We can use this to understand sympathy

Sympathy equally can be thought of as a kind of awareness. At least in a range of paradigm cases, we can think of it as an awareness of the feelings of someone else. For clarity of exposition, I want to restrict myself to such paradigm cases here.

Hisham is in panic because he's chased by a wild dog. Zaynab, an onlooker, has a sympathetic reaction to Hisham's suffering. She watches and hears Hisham and becomes 'feels along' with his anxiety. She's affected by his feelings. This is awareness by experience: it consists in Zaynab's feeling some way, a feeling that enables her to know that Hisham is in a state of terror.  

## This gives us four theories of sympathy
We can now see that applying the two earlier distinctions can shed light on what elements or relations are involved in Zaynab's sympathetic response. Is Zaynab's awareness mediated or not? Does it depend on the actuality of what she feels or not? We can represent the resulting four understanding of sympathy in a diagram.

SYMPATHY | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: Naïve realist | B: Intentionalist
Mediate | C: Contagion | D: Simulation

Alvin Goldman writes about sympathy that it is a low-level mental simulation "in which one mental process matches another one, or is launched in an attempt to match another one."[@goldman2009aa, p. 246] Similarly, in a recent paper Amy Coplan maintains that sympathising "the observer replicates or reconstructs the target's experiences", experiences that are not directly accessible through the observer's perception [@coplan2011aa, p. 5-6]. In fact, the vast majority of authors that have recently discussed sympathy more or less take it for granted that Zaynab's sympathy for Hisham is somehow mediated by her own feeling. When Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, the feeling she's immediately aware of is a 'mirror image' of Hisham's anxiety. Sympathy at root is a kind of 'replicating' or 'mirroring' of feeling. 

In other words, the current consensus among authors who assume that we have a sympathetic capacity is that sympathy either consists in a form of emotional contagion, or in a form of mental simulation. And if this is right, then the way of looking at the issue I propose here reveals current discussions to be limited in outlook. Besides discussions over details, they are constrained to the dispute over whether the contagion or the simulation model best captures our sympathetic responses.



(Note, there is a claim about low level empathy, by some called basic empathy, by others 'mirroring'. )


## Mediate and immediate sympathy
But let us now suppose that Hisham's anxiety is the immediate object of Zaynab's awareness. What Zayneb feels _is_ Hisham's fear---she does not to have any feeling of her own. This view will be shared by those 


A negative answer is what underpins most simulation approaches to sympathy. When we sympathise with someone, we simulate their mental state by 'running offline' some of our own mental processes. The result is a feeling of ours that figures as an encapsulated, offline element of our overall mental state. If the answer is yes, on the other hand, then we may say that the traditional way of thinking about sympathy as a capacity to 'feel what others feel' seems very apt.  

## Dependent and independent sympathetic awareness
On the other hand, o


Now, to our second question, Is Zaynab's sympathetic state dependent on the actual existence of its immediate object? We should keep in mind that, as we just saw, there will be two opposed views on what these immediate objects are. They are either the 'target' feelings of the other person, or they are something else. Can we experience a feeling of anxiety when there is none? If we think that sympathetic awareness is intentional, then this must be possible. If, on the other hand, we think of it as a dependent awareness, then it cannot be so. 

### Representationalism (A)

### Naïve realism (B)

As Whitehead characterises sympathy, it is "feeling the feeling _in_ another and feeling conformally _with_ another" [@whitehead1979aa, p. 162].     This captures both aspects of immediacy and dependence (you can't feel with another if the other doesn't feel it).

### Off-line simulation (C)

This seems to be what  

### Emotional contagion (D)

The fourth possibility is often thought of as an emotional contagion model of sympathy. We come to feel something ourselves and if we manage to use this feeling for sympathising, we come to use it as a proxy for what someone else feels. We're not aware of the other person's feelings, just of our own feelings that are roughly of the same kind. But the awareness depends on the actuality of what we feel. We actually suffer in sympathising with someone else who suffers. 

## Reflection

I want to make a few observations.

First a point about what is currently taken to be 'beyond dispute'. In the philosophy of perception, the main discussion is whether perception is dependent or independent. Most authors agree that the immediate object of awareness is just the object we are said to perceive. Although it is certainly not universal, the general consensus seems to be that perception does not involve awareness of any mediator or proxy. 

However, it is striking how rarely the option of an immediate awareness of someone else's feeling is even considered. The idea that sympathy with another's mental state is a mediated form of awareness is more or less beyond dispute. The main controversy is whether the feeling that functions as proxy for the other person's mental state is an actual feeling, or a merely imagined or 'off-line' one. This is the issue whether the awareness is dependent or independent.  



Perception are related to whole object, sympathy related to states or aspects of objects/people. But look: if those are concerns, then we are really pushing into the line of other mind scepticism. This allows me to spell out: feeling arent' visible, they don't reflect light etc. - Very similar to estimation .  

### What is the standard view? 

It seems to me that most philosophers nowadays tend towards the C option. When we sympathise, we imagine or represent to ourselves a feeling that is supposed to track or mirror the feeling of the other person. Such imagining can be understood as 'placing yourself in the other's shoes', or as a more basic 'mental simulation' by means of mirror neurons or what have you.

The B view does not seem attractive because it is only in pathological cases that we mistake the feeling we're aware of for something we actually feel. (Consider, the responses to one's own anxiety an the imagined anxiety of another will be very different: flight or aggression in the former case, concern or care in the latter.)

### What is the naïve view?   

What is the naïve view? I want to suggest that this is the view that we are immediately aware of the other person's feeling. I think this awareness is naïvely understood as a dependent form. So I want to suggest that, just as in perception, we may assume a naïve realism about sympathy unless we have compelling arguments to abandon that position. Such arguments may turn on the possibility of error or illusion, or they may turn on further metaphysical commitments that imply that we cannot become aware in this way of the mental states of others.

Concerns about phenomenology come in here. In perception, there arguably is a sense of presence. Is there a similar sense in the case of sympathy?

> One such process is a kind of ‘resonance’ which is more or less non-conscious. This is what Alvin Goldman calls ‘primitive, ‘low-level’ mind- reading’ (2006a: 113), and Karsten Steuber (2006) calls ‘basic empathy’. For example, in recognizing another’s face as expressing a certain emotion, ‘the observer’s emotional system “resonates” with that of the target, and this is the matching event on which the attribution is based’ (Goldman 2006a: 132). Goldman draws on a wide range of empirical data to lend support to the existence of this kind of low-level simulation, much of it based on the fascinating recent work on mirror neurons (see also Goldman this volume and Iacoboni this volume). [@coplan2011aa, p. 304]

### Sympathy as projective identification?

In previous discussions Louise Braddock has explored the way sympathy and projective identification relate. Projective identification is a complex phenomenon, involving the projection of a mental state into another person and the subsequent identification with that other person. This allows people to respond to and 'deal with' their own unwanted mental states in a detached and third or second-personal way. It's to that extent deceptive. 

Perhaps we only need to consider projection here. If sympathy involves projection, then which way does this run? Plausibly, it has to be a projection from sympathiser to sufferer, for it often happens that we sympathise with people who are not aware of being observed, and so arguably are in no position to project. (Perhaps we can introduce the activity of broadcasting for this circumstances.)




# Perception, moral sympathy, and episodic memory

Before concluding, it is insightful to compare the two schemas we have talked about so far with a third. Let's briefly turn to memory. 

## Episodic memory
Episodic memory is often thought of as a capacity for being affected by past events. It can be understood as a form of experiential awareness, just as perception and moral sympathy can. 

This is often maintained even by people who think of memory as essentially _reconstructive_. There is a long dispute in the philosophy of memory over the question whether remembering a past event depends on the actual occurrence of that event or not. In a flash I may episodically recall an occasion on which I was bullied in high school. Does my having that memory episode right now depend on the remembered occasion's actually having taken place? 'Dependent' theories of memory claim it does, 'independent' theories deny that. 

As a further question, we may ask whether the episode I undergo now, when I remember the bullying, is the event we claim to remember, or some other event? If it's another event, then again it seems that we're dealing with some kind of go-between or proxy for the event that's the 'target' of the memory. And so again we can see a split between 'mediate' and 'immediate' theories of memory. 

## The four theories of memory
MEMORY | Independent | Dependent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: Time-travelling | B: Reconstruction
Mediate | C: Re-enacting | D: Mental modelling

## Comparison with sympathy and perception
What is most interesting to observe here is that there is at least a prima facie plausibility to the Independent Mediator views in a way not found in perception. In remembering, we piece together a model of an event that is not actually going on, but merely imagined, and this imagined event stands in and aims to track or represent an earlier event, the event we claim to remember. These views are called naive indirect realists about memory, and face the question: what distinguishes memory from imagination [cf. Lawlor's chapter in @mclaughlin2009aa, p. 663]. On the other hand, the idea that an actual event is experienced, which mediates for a past event (call it the re-enactment view), is puzzling as an account of episodic memory.
