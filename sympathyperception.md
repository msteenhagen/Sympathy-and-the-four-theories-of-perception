abstract: Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'feel with' others. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. My aim is to bring out how it is all too easy to overlook viable options in the discussions about sympathy. In particular, I want to focus attention on why a 'direct' account of sympathy, one which allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is commonly ruled out _ab initio_.
...

Sympathy is the capacity to 'tap into someone else's feelings', to 'feel with them', or to 'feel what they feel'. What are the basic elements of an act of sympathising? I suggest that we can answer this question by turning to the philosophy of perception.

Comparing sympathy with perception brings out how it's all too easy to overlook viable options. I will highlight how much recent work tacitly rules out 'direct' accounts of sympathy--accounts that view sympathising as feeling the actual feelings of others.

Here's what I'll do. After setting out the background for understanding sympathy, I will apply a general framework for thinking about perception to our capacity of sympathy. That's the core of the paper. I'll suggest that a modern conception of psychology fosters the rejection of a 'naïve' account of sympathy. As I'll bring out, such a conception also underpins recent ethical worries about sympathy. If I'm right, then it's worthwhile to re-examine our basic commitments about sympathy.

# 'Feeling with' others

What I call 'sympathy' is often called 'empathy'. The labelling doesn't matter. By 'sympathy' I do not mean a specific kind of compassionate sentiment, but a general psychological capacity: the capacity to live through the mental states of others, whatever these states happen to be. Sympathy is a kind of openness to the mental lives of others.

Understanding the history of sympathy sheds important light on contemporary debates. The concept of sympathy, at least in philosophy and science, became prominent in Stoic writings. Back then it wasn't primarily a psychological notion, but a concept in physics. Philosophers recruited sympathy to explain cases of action at a distance. Think of the way the moon influences the tidal flow of our oceans. It does so without contact between the lunar surface and the seas. That's puzzling. The Stoics inferred that the cosmos must be a ‘sympathetic’ unity: that any of its parts can affect every other part without intermediaries. 

Now, to modern ears the idea of action at a distance will sound funny. Modern physics seeks explanations that trace series of proximal causes, consisting of vibrating air, molecular chain-reactions or propagating light waves.

But even today philosophy has room for the concept of sympathy. Although discredited in the natural sciences, sympathy lives on in the moral sphere. This is mainly due to English and Scottish enlightenment authors, for whom the problem of action at a distance re-emerged. We somehow feel affected by other minds. How can my impressions inform me about the ideas of other people? Sympathy gets introduced to explain this, and so moulds into the psychological shape we're familiar with. This is how I will understand the concept.

# Sympathy, awareness, perception

To sympathise with someone is to feel your way into their mental state. It's often taken to be a crucial element in mind-reading. At least often, an answer to how it is that Zayneb knows what Hisham is going through (if she know this) is that Zayneb sympathised with Hisham's feelings. Sympathy often is a source of knowledge about others.

Sense perception is a source of knowledge too. It's a form of awareness of our surroundings. This awareness is _experiential_, as we could put it. Perceiving a suspension bridge involves that bridge being part of your experience of things. Similarly, we may understand sympathy as a kind of experiential awareness. It is commonly contrasted with a mere inferential or theoretical understanding of other people's states. Sympathy can be a source of knowledge about others because of the specific _experience_ sympathising with someone involves.

## Two principles of delineation

I want to shed light on sympathetic awareness by looking at several ways we can understand perceptual awareness. In the philosophy of perception we find a clear delineation of views. Take that suspension bridge again. When you see that bridge, what elements and relations make up such an act? There are two important questions here. 

When you see that bridge, is the immediate object of your visual awareness the bridge, or is it something else, such as an image of the bridge, or the bridge's outer surface, or a bridge-like sense impression caused in you? Disputes over this question have a long, infamous history. The first question concerns the immediate object of perception.

The second question concerns the kind of awareness we have of the immediate object of perception. Whether it is a bridge or a sense impression, must these objects of awareness  exist or not? Could you have this awareness if the thing you became aware of did not exist? Can we think of it as a relation or form of contact with reality? Especially in the last decades, philosophers have debated what we should say about this, and nowadays this is a live debate.

Controversy besieges both these questions. But at least the basic distinctions here are straightforward. Let me say a little bit more about each of them.
    
### Mediate and immediate perception

First, mediate and immediate perception. Think of a painted portrait of your cousin. Your visual awareness of the portrait enables perceptual access to a person that, at least from where you're now, isn't immediately visible. In this way, the portrait functions as a _mediator_ in your perception. It enables you to see a relative, even though they are not  around.

Ordinary seeing doesn't involve awareness of paintings. But many authors have suggested that it involves awareness of some other kind of mediator. Many think Hume claims that seeing a suspension bridge is a visual awareness of a subjective, private complex of impressions that enables perceptual access to a bridge that lies beyond it.

So if we ask what the immediate object of visual awareness in perception is, we open up the issue of potential perceptual mediation. Is our perception of the world mediated or not? 

### Dependent and independent perception

Second, dependent and independent perception. Can our awareness occur independent of the existence of its immediate objects? Think of a case where someone is hallucinating. They report seeing a figure in the corner of a room. But there is no such figure. Can they still perceive that figure? Some say they can, others say they can't. Their dispute is over the immediate awareness constitutive of perceiving. We may distinguish between awareness that's dependent on its objects, and awareness that is merely 'intentional'. In recent discussion in the philosophy of perception this distinction has taken central stage.

## The four theories of perception 

Given these distinctions, we end up with four different ways of thinking about what perception involves. I'll continue focusing on vision. 

\vspace{1cm}

VISION | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | I. Naïve realist | II. Intentionalism
Mediate | III. Sense-datum | IV. ?

Naïve realism echoes common sense. It's the view that we are immediately aware of what we report to perceive, and that such awareness cannot occur if there's in fact nothing out there. An intentionalist agrees we're aware of what we report to perceive, but maintains that this awareness may occur regardless of whether its object is present or exists. The third view is best known through its defence by sense-datum theories, popular until the 1950s. Contrary to naïve realism and intentionalism, it maintains that in perception we're aware of a mediator or proxy that relays information about the objects in our environment we report to see. The remaining option is puzzling. This view concurs with sense-datum theory that perception requires mediators, but it claims our awareness of them may occur regardless of their existence. This is puzzling because it is unclear what motivates this specific combination of an intentionalist and a mediator view of vision.  

# The possibilities of sympathy

Let's now return to sympathy. I suggested we also think of sympathy as a kind of experiential awareness. At least in a range of paradigm cases, it's a source of knowledge of another's feelings that relies on a specific experience. That experience we report as "Feeling what someone else feels." 

Let's consider an example. Hisham is in panic because he's chased by a wild dog. Zaynab, an onlooker, has a sympathetic reaction to Hisham's suffering. She watches and hears Hisham, and 'feels along' with his anxiety. She's affected by his feelings. This is an experiential awareness consisting in Zaynab's becoming aware of a specific feeling that enables her to know that Hisham is in a state of terror.  

## The four theories of sympathy
We can now see that applying the two earlier distinctions helps see what could be going on in Zaynab's sympathetic response. Is her awareness mediated or not? Does it depend on the actual occurrence of what she feels or not? These questions make sense, and it is just not obvious what we should say in reply to each of them. 

## Diagnosis
Here we have the four most general theories of sympathy. We have theories that maintain that sympathising with another person's feeling is immediate, and theories that posit some mediator phenomenon. And we have theories that maintain that sympathising with another involves a merely intentional mode of awareness, and theories that deny this. Laying out the possibilities in this way allows us to make some observations.

SYMPATHY | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: 'Naïve realist' | B: 'Intentionalist'
Mediate | C: Contagion | D: Simulation

### Bias towards contagion and simulation
Alvin Goldman writes about sympathy that it is a low-level mental simulation in which one mental process "is launched in an attempt to _match_ another one."[@goldman2009aa, p. 246, my italics] In recognizing another’s face as expressing a certain emotion, "the observer’s emotional system 'resonates' with that of the target, and this is the matching event on which the attribution is based" [@goldman2006aa, p. 132]. Similarly, Amy Coplan maintains that sympathising "the observer _replicates_ or _reconstructs_ the target's experiences", experiences not directly accessible through the observer's perception [@coplan2011aa, pp. 5-6, my italics]. 

It strikes me that the vast majority of authors that have recently discussed sympathy seem to assume that Zaynab's own feeling must somehow mediate her sympathy for Hisham. When Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, the feeling she's immediately aware of is an 'image' of Hisham's anxiety. Authors assume that sympathy is at root a kind of 'copying' or 'mirroring' of feeling, where this copy either is a low-level, automatic response, or the project of a more sophisticated mechanism of simulation or imagination. 

In other words, the present consensus among authors who assume that we have a sympathetic capacity is that sympathy either consists in a form of emotional contagion, or in a form of mental simulation. That sympathy is a mediated form of awareness seems 'beyond dispute'. We now see how this ignores two potentially viable options, the ones that parallel naïve realism and intentionalism in the philosophy of perception. Let's briefly turn to these. 

### The possibility of 'immediate sympathy'
Suppose that Hisham's anxiety is the immediate object of Zaynab's awareness. What Zaynab feels _is_ Hisham's fear. Here sympathy does not require her to have any feeling of her own. People who accept this may disagree among each other about whether Zaynab's awareness of Hisham's fear is merely intentional or not. But either way, both parties can agree that the traditional way of thinking about sympathy as a capacity to 'feel what others feel' is spot on.

The disappearance of these positions from the discussion is a recent one. When I talked about the history of the concept, I suggested that authors introduced sympathy to allow a for an immediate influence of one being on another. We find defenders of this understanding even in the early twentieth century. Around 1928, Alfred North Whitehead characterised sympathy as "feeling the feeling _in_ another and feeling conformally _with_ another" [@whitehead1979aa, p. 162]. He explicitly allows for feeling to be _shared_ between individuals, and this characterisation seems to capture both aspects of immediacy and dependence.

### Why this oversight?

Why is it that the idea of---quite literally---feeling what another feels, as Whitehead seems to suggest, sounds so odd to many philosophers or psychologists? I think this is primarily because it contradicts a 'modern' intuition about psychology.   

It is a commonplace that feelings are essentially subjective, private states of mind, only accessible to the person in which they originate. Much the same holds for mental states more generally, at least in so far they involve affect or emotion. Yet, should we accept this? I want to suggest that the intuition is in conflict with the very phenomenon that led Hume and others to hold onto the ancient theory of sympathy.

In the _Treatise_, Hume struggles when he admits the manifestly social form human feeling _can_ take. As he writes, 

> No quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others, and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments, however different from, or even contrary to our own. (_Treatise_, §XI)

Hume's subsequent _theory_ of sympathy tries to harmonise such sympathetic responses with his general assumption that our consciousness strictly does not reach beyond the affections of our own mind. But just as most philosophers of perception have come to reject Hume's 'mediate' theory of sense impressions as the only possible account of our visual experience of our surroundings, perhaps there is reason to shun the narrowness of Hume's own theory of sympathy---a theory that still lies at the root of our own discussions.

This at least reveals a tension. On the one hand, we still feel the pull of those everyday cases in which the suffering or rapture of others is communicated to us in an affective way. On the other hand, our tradition of psychological theorising does not admit of feeling to 'travel' or 'spread out' beyond the individual. But then, we should ask, what makes us so confident that we can't share feeling? I suggest we at least aspire to move beyond our comfort zone, and comb through our background assumptions about feelings and other minds, instead of assuming that the eighteenth century settled the matter for once and for all.

# Ethics of sympathy

Observing this tension is relevant to discussing the ethical standing of sympathy. In recent years several authors have worried about sympathy's validity and reliability: does it track what it purports to, and can it ever succeed? 

Peter Goldie is a prominent critic. He spells out our capacity for sympathy in terms of imaginative perspective-shifting. Goldie thinks that when Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, Zaynab is imagining _being_ Hisham. In such an imaginative project, Zaynab becomes aware of imagined feelings she assigns to Hisham. Goldie's account entails that, strictly, it isn't Hisham's feeling Zaynab is aware of, but an imagined counterpart---indeed, a mediator. This is why Goldie feels compelled to conclude that Zaynab's sympathy is prone to distort Hisham's psychology: there always will be factors we leave out of such imaginative engagement---for instance, it matters that a feeling arose _in Hisham_ instead of Zaynab [@goldie2011ac, p. 14; @goldie2005aa]. Trying to apprehend one particular feeling by apprehending another, merely similar feeling _necessarily_ falls short.

But if sympathy were an immediate awareness of another person's mental state then Goldie's worry would not arise. No doubt it may be difficult to exercise our capacity for sympathy. Similarly, it can be hard to exercise our capacity for sight---seeing the farm animals on a dim-lit country road after dusk is far from easy. The point is that, if sympathy is a capacity for feeling someone else's feelings immediately, then it is at least in principle possible to succeed. 

This is one reason why the discussion over whether sympathising involves a mediating feeling or not matters. If sympathy is always mediated by some feelings originating in us, then Goldie's concerns arise; but if it's not, then sympathising may be among the most valuable ways of directly relating to others.

# Conclusions

This is just the starting point of a discussion. Although historically, all four possible theories of sympathy received attention, I worry that nowadays philosophers start ordering their meals without having flipped the menu. I've tried to exploit an analogy with perception to bring out the diversity of ways of understanding sympathy. More specifically, I suggested that we may want to take serious an understanding of sympathy as a form of immediate awareness of the feelings of others.

I haven't defended that theory. My main point is that taking the full range of options into consideration, and reflecting more carefully on the arguments that speak in favour or against them, forces us to retrace some of our steps.
