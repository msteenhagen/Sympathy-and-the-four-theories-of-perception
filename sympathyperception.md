abstract: Sympathy is a capacity to 'feel with' others. I approach this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. I bring out how it is all too easy to overlook viable options in the discussions about sympathy. In particular, I want to focus attention on why an 'immediate' account of sympathy is commonly ruled out from the beginning.

Sympathy is the capacity to 'tap into someone else's feelings', to 'feel with them', or to 'feel what they feel'. What are the basic elements of an act of sympathising? I suggest that we can answer this question by turning to the philosophy of perception.

Comparing sympathy with perception brings out how it's all too easy to overlook viable options. I will highlight how much recent work tacitly rules out 'direct' accounts of sympathy--accounts that view sympathising as feeling the actual feelings of others.

Here's what I'll do. After setting out the background for understanding sympathy, I will apply a general framework for thinking about perception to our capacity of sympathy. That's the core of the paper. I'll suggest that a modern conception of psychology fosters the rejection of a 'naïve' account of sympathy. As I'll bring out, such a conception also underpins recent ethical worries about sympathy. If I'm right, then it's worthwhile to re-examine our basic commitments about sympathy.

# 'Feeling with' others

What I call 'sympathy' is often called 'empathy'. The labelling doesn't matter. By 'sympathy' I do not mean a specific kind of compassionate sentiment, but a general psychological capacity: the capacity to live through the mental states of others, whatever these states happen to be. Sympathy is a kind of openness to the mental lives of others.

Understanding the history of sympathy sheds important light on contemporary debates. The concept of sympathy, at least in philosophy and science, became prominent in Stoic writings. Back then it wasn't primarily a psychological notion, but a concept in physics. Philosophers recruited sympathy to explain cases of action at a distance. Think of the way the moon influences the tidal flow of our oceans. It does so without contact between the lunar surface and the seas. That's puzzling. The Stoics inferred that the cosmos must be a ‘sympathetic’ unity: that any of its parts can affect every other part without intermediaries. 

Now, to modern ears the idea of action at a distance will sound funny. Modern physics seeks explanations that trace series of proximal causes, consisting of vibrating air, molecular chain-reactions or propagating light waves.

But even today philosophy has room for the concept of sympathy. Although discredited in the natural sciences, sympathy lives on in the moral sphere. This is mainly due to English and Scottish enlightenment authors, for whom the problem of action at a distance re-emerged. We somehow feel affected by other minds. How can my impressions inform me about the ideas of other people? Sympathy gets introduced to explain this, and so moulds into the psychological shape we're familiar with. This is how I will understand the concept.

# Sympathy, awareness, perception

To sympathise with someone is to feel your way into their mental state. It's often taken to be a crucial element in mind-reading. Often an answer to how Zayneb knows what Hisham is going through (if she know this) is that Zayneb sympathised with Hisham's feelings. Sympathy often is a source of knowledge about others.

Sense perception is a source of knowledge too. It's a form of awareness of our surroundings. This awareness is _experiential_. Perceiving a suspension bridge means that you experience that bridge. Similarly, we may understand sympathy as a kind of experiential awareness. It is commonly contrasted with inferential or theoretical understanding of other people's states. Sympathy can be a source of knowledge about others because sympathising with someone is an _experience_.

## Two principles of delineation

I want to illuminate sympathetic awareness by comparing it to perceptual awareness. The philosophy of perception presents a clear delineation of views. Take that suspension bridge again. When you see that bridge, what elements make up such an act? Two important questions arise. 

When you see that bridge, is the bridge the immediate object of your visual awareness, or something else, such as an image of the bridge, the bridge's outer surface, or a bridge-like sense impression you had? This question has a long, infamous history. It concerns the immediate object of perception.

The second question concerns the kind of awareness we have of the immediate object of perception. Whether it is a bridge or a sense impression, must these objects of awareness  exist or not? Could you have this awareness if the thing you became aware of did not exist? Is it a form of contact with reality? The answers are currently still debated.

Controversy besieges both these questions. But at least the basic distinctions are straightforward. Let me say a little bit more about each of them.
    
### Mediate and immediate perception

First, mediate and immediate perception. Think of a painted portrait of your cousin. Your awareness of the portrait enables you to see a person who isn't immediately visible in your surroundings. The portrait functions as a _mediator_ in your perception. It enables you to see a relative, even though they are not around.

Ordinary seeing doesn't involve awareness of paintings. But many have suggested that it involves awareness of another kind of mediator. Hume, for one, claims that seeing a suspension bridge is a visual awareness of a private complex of impressions that enables you to see a bridge.

When asking about the immediate object of visual awareness in perception, we run into the issue of perceptual mediation. Is our perception of the world mediated, or not? 

### Dependent and independent perception

Second, dependent and independent perception. Is our awareness dependent on its immediate objects--such as bridges and cousins? Suppose someone is hallucinating. They report seeing a figure in the corner of a room. But there is no such figure. Can they still perceive that figure? Some say they can, others say they can't. Their dispute is over the immediate awareness that constitutes perceiving. Either the awareness is dependent on its objects, or it is merely 'intentional'. This distinction is central in recent discussions of perception.

## The four theories of perception 

These distinctions give us four different ways of thinking about what perception involves. I'll continue focusing on vision. 

\vspace{1cm}

VISION | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | I. Naïve realist | II. Intentionalism
Mediate | III. Sense-datum | IV. ?

Naïve realism echoes common sense. It's the view that we are immediately aware of what we report to perceive, and that such awareness cannot occur if there's in fact nothing there. An intentionalist agrees we're aware of what we report to perceive, but maintains that this awareness may occur regardless of whether its object exists or not. The third view is best known through its defence by sense-datum theories, popular until the 1950s. Contrary to naïve realism and intentionalism, sense-datum theory maintains that perception is awareness of a mediator or proxy that relays information about the objects in our environment we report to see. The fourth option is puzzling. It holds that perception requires mediators, but claims that our awareness of them may occur regardless of their existence. It is unclear what could motivate this view. Still, it would just be too quick to dismiss it without argument. 

# The possibilities of sympathy

Let's now return to sympathy. I suggested that sympathy is a kind of experiential awareness. In paradigm cases, it's a source of knowledge of another's feelings. It relies on an experience that we report as "Feeling what someone else feels." 

Consider an example. Hisham is in panic because he's being chased by a wild dog. Zaynab has a sympathetic reaction to Hisham's suffering. She watches and hears Hisham, and 'feels along' with his anxiety. She's affected by his feelings. Zaynab becomes aware of a specific feeling that enables her to know that Hisham is in a state of terror.

Applying the two earlier distinctions from philosophy of perception can help clarify Zaynab's sympathetic response. Is her awareness mediated or not? Does it depend on the actual occurrence of what she feels or not? Answers to these questions carve out four general theories of sympathy. These are the options: either sympathising with another person's feeling is immediate, or there is some mediator. And either sympathising with another involves a merely intentional mode of awareness, or it does not. These systematic options invite some observations.

SYMPATHY | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: 'Naïve realist' | B: 'Intentionalist'
Mediate | C: Contagion | D: Simulation

## Bias towards contagion and simulation
Alvin Goldman writes about sympathy that it is a low-level mental simulation in which one mental process "is launched in an attempt to _match_ another one."[@goldman2009aa, p. 246, my italics] In recognising another’s face as expressing a certain emotion, "the observer’s emotional system 'resonates' with that of the target, and this is the matching event on which the attribution is based" [@goldman2006aa, p. 132]. Similarly, Amy Coplan maintains that sympathising "the observer _replicates_ or _reconstructs_ the target's experiences", experiences not directly accessible to an observer [@coplan2011aa, pp. 5-6, my italics]. 

It strikes me that the vast majority of recent authors seem to assume that Zaynab's own feeling mediates her sympathy for Hisham. When Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, the feeling she's immediately aware of is an 'image' of Hisham's anxiety. On this model sympathy is a kind of 'copying' of feeling, where such copy either is a low-level, automatic response, or involves a more sophisticated mechanism of simulation or imagination. 

In short, authors understand sympathy either as a form of emotional contagion, or as a form of mental simulation. That sympathy is mediated awareness seems 'beyond dispute'. But this ignores two of the four available options, those that parallel naïve realism and intentionalism in the philosophy of perception. Let's turn to these. 

## The possibility of 'immediate sympathy'
Suppose that Hisham's anxiety is the immediate object of Zaynab's awareness. What Zaynab feels _is_ Hisham's fear. Here sympathy does not require her to have any feeling of her own. Whether Zaynab's awareness of Hisham's fear is merely intentional or not, on this line of thinking the view of sympathy as a capacity to 'feel what others feel' is spot on.

The disappearance of these positions from the discussion is a recent one. Stoic authors introduced sympathy to allow a for one thing immediately influencing another. As late as 1928, Alfred North Whitehead characterised sympathy as "feeling the feeling _in_ another and feeling conformally _with_ another" [@whitehead1979aa, p. 162]. Whitehead explicitly allows for feeling to be _shared_ between individuals, in a way that is immediate and dependent.

## Why this oversight?

Why does the idea of feeling what another feels sounds so odd to many contemporary ears? I suggest that it contradicts a 'modern' intuition about psychology.   

It is a commonplace that feelings are essentially subjective, private states of mind, only accessible to the person in whom they originate. This holds for mental states generally, especially where they involve affect or emotion. Should we accept this? I suggest that this intuition conflicts with the phenomenon that led Hume and others to revive the ancient theory of sympathy.

In the _Treatise_, Hume struggles to admit the manifestly social form that human feeling _can_ take. As he writes, 

> No quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others, and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments, however different from, or even contrary to our own. (_Treatise_, §XI)

As I read him, Hume tries to harmonise such sympathetic responses with his general assumption that our consciousness strictly does not reach beyond the affections of our own mind. Hume's theory of sympathy lies at the root of our own discussions. But just as most philosophers of perception have come to reject Hume's 'mediate' theory of sense impressions, perhaps we should shun the narrowness of Hume's theory of sympathy too?

This reveals a tension. On the one hand, we feel the pull of everyday cases in which the suffering of others is communicated to us affectively. On the other hand, our psychological theorising does not admit feeling to 'travel' beyond the individual. But what makes us so confident that we can't share feeling? Let's move beyond our comfort zone and assess our assumptions about feelings and other minds. The eighteenth century needn't settle things once and for all.

# Ethics of sympathy

This tension between everyday and theoretical convictions has implications for the ethics of sympathy. Recent authors have worried about sympathy's reliability: does it track what it purports to, and can it ever succeed? 

Peter Goldie is a prominent critic. He spells out sympathy in terms of imaginative perspective-shifting. Goldie thinks that when Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, Zaynab imagines _being_ Hisham. In such an imaginative project, Zaynab becomes aware of imagined feelings she assigns to Hisham. Strictly, Zaynab isn't aware of Hisham's feeling, but of an imagined counterpart---a mediator. Hence Goldie concludes that sympathy is prone to distort: there always will be some factors left out of such imaginative engagement [@goldie2011ac, p. 14; @goldie2005aa]. Trying to apprehend one feeling by apprehending a similar but different one _necessarily_ falls short.

But if sympathy gave immediate awareness of another person's state, then Goldie's worry would not arise. No doubt it may be difficult to exercise our capacity for sympathy, just as it can be hard to exercise our capacity for sight---seeing the farm animals on a dim-lit country road after dusk is far from easy. If sympathy is a capacity for feeling someone else's feelings immediately, it is at least possible to succeed. 

This is why my earlier discussion of sympathy matters. If sympathy were always mediated by some feelings originating in us, then Goldie's concerns would arise. If not, then sympathising might just be an invaluable way of relating to others.

# Conclusions

This is just the starting point of a discussion. Although historically, all four possible theories of sympathy received attention, I worry that nowadays philosophers start ordering their meals without having flipped the menu. Through the analogy with perception I have brought out further ways of understanding sympathy. More specifically, I suggested that we may want to take seriously an understanding of sympathy as a form of immediate awareness of the feelings of others.

I haven't defended that theory. My main point is that systematically assessing the full range of options forces us to retrace some of our steps.
