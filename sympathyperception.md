Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'tap into someone else's feelings', to 'feel with them', or to 'feel what they feel'. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. The serious philosophical issue about sympathy I am interested in is that of understanding the basic elements and relations involved in an act of sympathising. And the fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception I'll talk about is precisely about such basic elements and relations, but then how they are involved in our perceptual awareness of our surroundings. 

Comparing sympathy with perception brings out how it is all too easy to overlook viable options. In particular, I want to flag that a naïve, 'direct' account of sympathy that allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is frequently not even considered an available view. 

After some brief remarks about terminology and the history of sympathy, I will apply a framework for thinking about perception to our capacity of sympathy. That's the core of the paper, and I will make some observations about the 'space of possibilities' as it emerges from this comparison. I'll suggest that a modern conception of psychology fosters the intuition that a 'naïve' account of sympathy somehow assumes we have access to the inaccessible. And as I'll bring out, a bias towards a specific understanding of sympathy underpins an important ethical criticism of sympathy that recently has gained in prominence. If I'm right and there is this bias, then it's worthwhile taking the analogy with perception seriously, and start exploring some overlooked options.  

# 'Feeling with' others

What I call 'sympathy' is nowadays often called empathy. The labelling doesn't matter. What matters is that by 'sympathy' I don't mean a specific kind of compassionate sentiment, but a general psychological capacity we seem to have: the capacity to become aware of, or in some way experience or live through the mental states or sentiments of others, _whatever these states or sentiments happen to be_. Sympathy is a kind of openness to the mental lives of other people. 

Understanding the history of sympathy sheds important light on which puzzle it is meant to solve in contemporary debates. The concept of sympathy, at least in philosophy and science, came first into prominence in Stoic writings. It was not then primarily a psychological notion, but a concept in physics or cosmology. It was recruited to explain cases of action at a distance. Think of the way the moon influences the tidal flow of our oceans. It does so without their being any contact between the lunar surface and the seas. This phenomena are puzzling. The Stoics inferred that they show that the cosmos is a ‘sympathetic’ unity: any part of the cosmos has the potential to affect every other part without intermediaries. 

Now, to modern ears---ears used to cool mechanism---the very idea of action at a distance will sound funny, contradictory, even. Modern cosmology and physics aspires to explanations that trace series of proximal causes, consisting of vibrating air, molecular chain-reactions, propagating light waves, etc.

But even today philosophy has room for the concept of sympathy. Although it's discredited as an explanatory concept in the natural sciences, sympathy lives on in the moral sphere, as English and Scottish enlightenment authors became interested in it. For these authors the problem of action at a distance re-emerged. In some way, we have access to and even seem to be affected by the contents of another individual's mind. How can I know on the basis of my sensations, impressions or ideas about the sensations, impressions or ideas this other person has? Sympathy gets introduced to explain this, and so gets moulded into the psychological shape we're familiar with. This is how I will understand the concept in what follows.

# Sympathy, awareness, perception

To sympathise with someone is to feel your way into their mental state. It is often taken to be a crucial element in mind-reading, and arguably plays a role in our capacity for concerted agency or thought. At least often, an answer to how it is that Zayneb knows what Hisham is going through (if she know this) is found in the fact that Zayneb is able to sympathise with Hisham's feelings. A sympathetic response often is a source of knowledge about others.

Sense perception, which is a source of knowledge too, can be thought of as a form of awareness of our surroundings. This awareness is _experiential_, as we could put it. Perceiving a suspension bridge involves that bridge making its way into your experience of your surroundings. I think that, similarly, sympathy can be thought of as a kind of experiential awareness. It is commonly contrasted with a mere inferential or theoretical understanding of other people's states. Sympathy can be a source of knowledge about others because of the specific _experience_ a sympathetic response involves.

## Two principles of delineation

What is it to perceive something? There are several ways we can understand perception, and in the philosophy of perception we find a clear delineation of views. Let's focus on vision. Take that suspension bridge again. When you see that bridge, what elements and relations are involved in such an act? There are two important questions we may ask. 

When you see that bridge, is the immediate object of your visual awareness the bridge, or is it something else, such as an image of the bridge, or the bridge's outer surface, or a bridge-like visual sensation caused in you? Disputes over this question have a long, infamous history.

Second, we may ask whether the immediate awareness we have, whether it is of the bridge or of something else, depends for its occurrence on the actuality or existence of what we're aware of. Could you have this awareness if the thing you become aware of did not exist? Can we think of it as a relation or form of contact with reality? Especially in the last decades, philosophers have debated what we should say about this, and this issue is very much alive today. 

Both these questions are besieged by controversy, but I think that at least the basic distinctions here are straightforward. Let me say a little bit more about each of them.
    
### Mediate and immediate perception

Think of a painted portrait of a distant relative. Your visual awareness of the portrait enables perceptual access to a person that, at least from where you're now, cannot be perceived immediately. In this way, the portrait may be thought of as a mediator in your visual perception. 

Now, an ordinary case of seeing a suspension bridge doesn't involve awareness of painted portraits, but many authors have suggested that it involves awareness of some other kind of mediator or go-between. One way of understanding Hume's theory of sense impressions is as a view according to which seeing a suspension bridge is constituted by a visual awareness of a subjective, private complex of impressions that enables perceptual access to a bridge that lies beyond it.

So if we ask what the immediate object of visual awareness in perception is, we open up this issue of potential perceptual mediation. Is our perception of the world mediated or not? A mediator in perception is some object of awareness that functions as a proxy or go-between, and that enables perceptual access to things that lie beyond it. 

### Dependent and independent perception

Does our awareness depend for its occurrence on the existence of its immediate objects? Think of a case where someone is hallucinating. They maintain that they see a figure in the corner of a room where there is just no such figure. Is this a possible perception? Some say it is not, others say it is. 

The second distinction then concerns the immediate awareness that is constitutive of acts of perceiving. We may distinguish between awareness that's dependent on its objects, and awareness that isn't. This distinction has taken central stage in recent discussion in the philosophy of perception.

## The four theories of perception 

Given these distinctions, we end up with four different ways of thinking about what perception involves. Again, I will focus on vision. 

VISION | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | I. Naïve realist | II. Intentionalism
Mediate | III. Sense-datum | IV. ?

The __first__ view, naïve realism is arguably the view of common sense. It's the view that we are directly aware of what we report to perceive, and that such awareness cannot occur if there's in fact nothing out there. In such a case we're under the spell of hallucination. The __second__ position is frequently called 'intentionalism', and is currently most popular among philosophers. The intentionalist agrees that we're aware of what we report to perceive, but maintains that this awareness may occur regardless of whether its object is present or exists. The __third__ view is best known through its defence by sense-datum theories, popular until the 1950s. Contrary to naïve realism and intentionalism, it maintains that in perception we're aware of a mediator or proxy that relays information about the objects in our environment we report to see.

The __fourth__ view is somewhat puzzling. This view agrees with sense-datum theory that perception consists first and foremost of the awareness of a mediator, but it claims that this awareness may occur regardless of whether such a mediator is actually present to the mind. Charles Travis claims C is incoherent as a theory of perception because it cannot explain the basic fact of something's appearing to us [cf. @travis2004aa; @travis2013aa, Ch. 1].

# The possibilities of sympathy

I suggested that sympathy can be thought of as a kind of experiential awareness too. At least in a range of paradigm cases, we can think of it as a source of knowledge of the feelings of someone else that relies on a specific experience. What we experience is reported as "Feeling what someone else feels". 

Let's consider an example. Hisham is in panic because he's chased by a wild dog. Zaynab, an onlooker, has a sympathetic reaction to Hisham's suffering. She watches and hears Hisham, and 'feels along' with his anxiety. She's affected by his feelings. This is an experiential awareness consisting in Zaynab's becoming aware of a specific feeling that enables her to know that Hisham is in a state of terror.  

## The four theories of sympathy
We can now see that applying the two earlier distinctions can shed light on what elements or relations are involved in Zaynab's sympathetic response. Is Zaynab's awareness mediated or not? Does it depend on the actuality of what she feels or not? These questions make sense, and it is just not obvious what we should say in reply to each of them. We can represent the resulting four understanding of sympathy in a diagram.

SYMPATHY | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: Naïve realist | B: Intentionalist
Mediate | C: Contagion | D: Simulation

## Diagnosis
Laying out the possibilities in this way allows us to make some observations. 

### Bias towards contagion and simulation
At least in recent literature, there is a striking bias towards the options in the second row of our diagram---what I've labelled the contagion and simulation theories. 

Alvin Goldman writes about sympathy that it is a low-level mental simulation "in which one mental process _matches_ another one, or is launched in an attempt to _match_ another one."[@goldman2009aa, p. 246, my italics] Elsewhere, he writes that in recognizing another’s face as expressing a certain emotion, "the observer’s emotional system 'resonates' with that of the target, and this is the matching event on which the attribution is based’[@goldman2006aa, p. 132]. Similarly, in a recent paper Amy Coplan maintains that sympathising "the observer _replicates_ or _reconstructs_ the target's experiences", experiences that are not directly accessible through the observer's perception [@coplan2011aa, pp. 5-6, my italics]. 

It strikes me that the vast majority of authors that have recently discussed sympathy seem to assume that Zaynab's sympathy for Hisham must somehow be mediated by her own feeling. When Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, the feeling she's immediately aware of is a 'mirror image' of Hisham's anxiety. Sympathy, it is assumed, is at root a kind of 'replicating' or 'mirroring' of feeling, where this replication either is a low-level, automatic response, or the project of a more sophisticated, top-down mechanism of simulation or imagination. In other words, the current consensus among authors who assume that we have a sympathetic capacity is that sympathy either consists in a form of emotional contagion, or in a form of mental simulation. 

If this is right, then the way of looking at the issue I propose here reveals current discussions to be limited in outlook. Apart from discussions over details, they are constrained to the dispute over whether the contagion or the simulation model best captures our sympathetic responses. That sympathy is a mediated form of awareness seems currently 'beyond dispute'. We see how this ignores two potentially viable options, the ones that parallel naïve realism and intentionalism in the philosophy of perception. Let's briefly turn to these. 

### The possibility of 'immediate sympathy'
Suppose that Hisham's anxiety is the immediate object of Zaynab's awareness. What Zayneb feels _is_ Hisham's fear---sympathy does not require her to have any feeling of her own. The contagion model suggests that both become ill. In the dependant camp, the contagion model can be contrasted with a communion model. What is crucial is that, if we feel anxiety here, it is not our own: it is the other person's, or perhaps an interpersonal form of fear. We see how the traditional way of thinking about sympathy as a capacity to 'feel what others feel' seems very apt, given the assumption of an immediate awareness of the other's feelings. 

In recent discussions these positions have been ignored, I think. This does not mean that the view has never been taken seriously. As I suggested earlier, the concept of sympathy was introduced precisely to make possible a kind of immediate influence of one being on another. An early twentieth century defender of this understanding of sympathy is Alfred North Whitehead. As he characterises sympathy, it is "feeling the feeling _in_ another and feeling conformally _with_ another" [@whitehead1979aa, p. 162]. Whitehead wants to allow for feeling to be shared between individuals, and his characterisation seems to capture both aspects of immediacy and dependence. 

### Why this oversight?

Why is it that the idea of feeling what another feels, when taken literally as Whitehead seems to suggest, sounds so odd to us?  

But also here the analogy with perception should make us pause. 

### Ethics of sympathy

This observation is relevant for how we think of the ethical standing of our capacity to feel what others feel. In recent years several authors have worried about the 'validity' and 'reliability' of sympathy: does it really track what it purports to. 

For instance, Peter Goldie spells out our capacity for sympathy in terms of imaginative perspective-shifting. He thinks that when Zaynap is sympathises with Hisham, Zaynap is imagining being Hisham. In such an imaginative project, Zaynap will become aware of an imagined feeling that is ascribed to Hisham. I think it's fair to say that Goldie's account entails that, strictly, it isn't Hisham's feeling Zaynap is aware of, but an imagined counterpart---indeed, a mediator. This is why Goldie feels compelled to conclude that Zaynap's sympathy is prone to distort Hisham's psychology considerably: there inevitably will be factors we leave out of such imaginative engagement, not insignificantly the fact that it matters that a feeling arose in _Hisham_, instead of in Zaynap's imagination [@goldie2011ac, p. 14; see also @goldie2005aa]. Trying to apprehend the one particular feeling by apprehending another feeling that's merely similar necessarily falls short.

But if sympathy is understood as an immediate awareness of another person's mental state---if we can genuinely be said to feel their feelings---then Goldie's worry does not arise. Of course, it may be difficult to exercise our capacity for sympathy, just as it can be hard to exercise our capacity for sight in a situation that requires sustained attention and perceptual agility. But the point is that, if sympathy is a capacity for feeling someone else's feelings immediately, then it is at least in principle possible to succeed. 

This is one reason why the discussion over whether sympathy is a mediate form of awareness or not is relevant. If it's necessarily mediated, then we have reason for ethical scepticism; but if it can be immediate, then perhaps its one of the most valuable ways we have to relate to others. 

# Conclusions

This is just the starting point of a discussion. I've tried to exploit an analogy with perception to bring out that sympathetic engagement may be theorised as a form of immediate awareness. This leaves it open whether this awareness is a straightforward apprehension of the other person's feelings, or whether it is some intentional state that aims at this feeling. Although historically, all four possible theories of sympathy received attention, I worry that nowadays philosophers start ordering their meals without having flipped the menu. Taking the full range of options into consideration, and reflecting more carefully on the arguments that speak in favour or against them can have important ethical implications; it is likely to shed a brighter light on how we must understand ourselves in relation to one another.
