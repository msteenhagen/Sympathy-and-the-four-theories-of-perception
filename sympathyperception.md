abstract: Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'feel with' others. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. My aim is to bring out how it is all to easy to overlook viable options in the discussions about sympathy. In particular, I want to focus attention on why a 'direct' account of sympathy, one which allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is commonly ruled out ab initio.

My aim is to bring out how it is all to easy to overlook viable options in the discussions about sympathy. In particular, I want to focus attention on why a 'direct' account of sympathy, one which allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is commonly ruled out _ab initio_.
