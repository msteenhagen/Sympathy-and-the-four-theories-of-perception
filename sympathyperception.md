abstract: Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'feel with' others. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. My aim is to bring out how it is all too easy to overlook viable options in the discussions about sympathy. In particular, I want to focus attention on why a 'direct' account of sympathy, one which allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is commonly ruled out _ab initio_.
...

Sympathy is the capacity to 'tap into someone else's feelings', to 'feel with them', or to 'feel what they feel'. We can approach this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. A serious philosophical issue about sympathy that deserves attention is that of understanding the basic elements and relations involved in an act of sympathising. The fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception I'll talk about is precisely about such basic elements and relations, but then how these enable perceptual awareness of our surroundings. 

Comparing sympathy with perception brings out how it's all too easy to overlook viable options. In particular, I want to highlight that a naïve, or 'direct' account of sympathy that allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is frequently not even considered an available view. 

Here's what I'll do. After some brief remarks about terminology and the history of sympathy, I will apply a framework for thinking about perception to our capacity of sympathy. That's the core of the paper, and I will make some observations about the 'space of possibilities' as it emerges from this comparison. I'll suggest that a modern conception of psychology fosters the intuition that a 'naïve' account of sympathy would somehow assume we have access to the inaccessible. And as I'll bring out, it underpins an important ethical criticism of sympathy that recently has gained in prominence. If I'm right, then it's worthwhile taking the analogy with perception seriously, and start exploring the overlooked options it helps us get into view.  

# 'Feeling with' others

Nowadays, what I call 'sympathy' is often called empathy. The labelling doesn't matter. What matters is that by 'sympathy' I don't mean a specific kind of compassionate sentiment, but a general psychological capacity we seem to have: the capacity to experience or live through the mental states or sentiments of others, _whatever these states or sentiments happen to be_. Sympathy is a kind of openness to the mental lives of other people. 

Understanding the history of sympathy sheds important light on which puzzle it is meant to solve in contemporary debates. The concept of sympathy, at least in philosophy and science, came first into prominence in Stoic writings. It was not then primarily a psychological notion, but a concept in physics or cosmology. It was recruited to explain cases of action at a distance. Think of the way the moon influences the tidal flow of our oceans. It does so without their being any contact between the lunar surface and the seas. Phenomena like this are puzzling. The Stoics inferred that they show that the cosmos is a ‘sympathetic’ unity: any part of the cosmos has the potential to affect every other part without intermediaries. 

Now, to modern ears---ears used to cool mechanism---the very idea of action at a distance will sound funny, contradictory, even. Modern cosmology and physics aspires to explanations that trace series of proximal causes, consisting of vibrating air, molecular chain-reactions or propagating light waves.

But even today philosophy has room for the concept of sympathy. Although it's discredited in the natural sciences, sympathy lives on in the moral sphere, as English and Scottish enlightenment authors theorised it. For these authors the problem of action at a distance re-emerged. In some way, we have access to and even seem to be affected by the contents of another individual's mind. How can I know on the basis of my sensations, impressions or ideas about the sensations, impressions or ideas this other person has? Sympathy gets introduced to explain this, and so gets moulded into the psychological shape we're familiar with. This is how I will understand the concept in what follows.

# Sympathy, awareness, perception

To sympathise with someone is to feel your way into their mental state. It's often taken to be a crucial element in mind-reading. At least often, an answer to how it is that Zayneb knows what Hisham is going through (if she know this) is found in the fact that Zayneb is able to sympathise with Hisham's feelings. A sympathetic response often is a source of knowledge about others.

Sense perception is a source of knowledge too. It can be thought of as a form of awareness of our surroundings. This awareness is _experiential_, as we could put it. Perceiving a suspension bridge involves that bridge making its way into your experience of your surroundings. I think that, similarly, sympathy can be thought of as a kind of experiential awareness. It is commonly contrasted with a mere inferential or theoretical understanding of other people's states. Sympathy can be a source of knowledge about others because of the specific _experience_ a sympathetic response involves.

## Two principles of delineation

I want to shed light on sympathetic awareness by looking at several ways we can understand perceptual awareness. In the philosophy of perception we find a clear delineation of views. Let's focus on vision. And take that suspension bridge again. When you see that bridge, what elements and relations are involved in such an act? There are two important questions we may ask. 

When you see that bridge, is the immediate object of your visual awareness the bridge, or is it something else, such as an image of the bridge, or the bridge's outer surface, or a bridge-like sense impression caused in you? Disputes over this question have a long, infamous history. The first question concerns the immediate object of perception.

The second question concerns the kind of awareness we have of the immediate object of perception. Whether it is a bridge or a sense impression, must these objects of awareness  exist or not? Could you have this awareness if the thing you became aware of did not exist? Can we think of it as a relation or form of contact with reality? Especially in the last decades, philosophers have debated what we should say about this, and this issue is very much alive today. 

Both these questions are besieged by controversy, but I think that at least the basic distinctions here are straightforward. Let me say a little bit more about each of them.
    
### Mediate and immediate perception

First, mediate and immediate perception. Think of a painted portrait of a distant relative. Your visual awareness of the portrait enables perceptual access to a person that, at least from where you're now, cannot be perceived immediately. In this way, the portrait may be thought of as a mediator in your visual perception. The portrait enables you to see the relative, even though they are not currently around.

Ordinary seeing doesn't involve awareness of painted portraits. But many authors have suggested that it involves awareness of some other kind of mediator. Hume's theory of sense impressions can be read as claiming that seeing a suspension bridge is constituted by a visual awareness of a subjective, private complex of impressions that enables perceptual access to a bridge that lies beyond it.

So if we ask what the immediate object of visual awareness in perception is, we open up this issue of potential perceptual mediation. Is our perception of the world mediated or not? 

### Dependent and independent perception

Second, dependent and independent perception. Does our awareness depend for its occurrence on the existence of its immediate objects? Think of a case where someone is hallucinating. They report seeing a figure in the corner of a room. But there is no such figure. Do they perceive that figure? Some say they do, others say they don't. Their dispute is over the immediate awareness that is constitutive of acts of perceiving. We may distinguish between awareness that's dependent on its objects, and awareness that is merely 'intentional'. This distinction has taken central stage in recent discussion in the philosophy of perception.

## The four theories of perception 

Given these distinctions, we end up with four different ways of thinking about what perception involves. I'll continue focusing on vision. 

VISION | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | I. Naïve realist | II. Intentionalism
Mediate | III. Sense-datum | IV. ?

Naïve realism is the view of common sense. It's the view that we are immediately aware of what we report to perceive, and that such awareness cannot occur if there's in fact nothing out there. The __second__ position is frequently called 'intentionalism', and is currently most popular among philosophers. They agree we're aware of what we report to perceive, but maintains that this awareness may occur regardless of whether its object is present or exists. It's merely intentional. The __third__ view is best known through its defence by sense-datum theories, popular until the 1950s. Contrary to naïve realism and intentionalism, it maintains that in perception we're aware of a mediator or proxy that relays information about the objects in our environment we report to see. The __fourth__ option is somewhat puzzling. This view agrees with sense-datum theory that perception consists first and foremost of the awareness of a mediator, but it claims that this awareness may occur regardless of whether such a mediator is actually present to the mind. It's puzzling because it is unclear what motivates this specific combination of an intentionalist and a mediator view of vision.  

# The possibilities of sympathy

Let's now return to sympathy. I suggested that sympathy can be thought of as a kind of experiential awareness too. At least in a range of paradigm cases, we can think of it as a source of knowledge of the feelings of someone else that relies on a specific experience. What we experience is reported as "Feeling what someone else feels". 

Let's consider an example. Hisham is in panic because he's chased by a wild dog. Zaynab, an onlooker, has a sympathetic reaction to Hisham's suffering. She watches and hears Hisham, and 'feels along' with his anxiety. She's affected by his feelings. This is an experiential awareness consisting in Zaynab's becoming aware of a specific feeling that enables her to know that Hisham is in a state of terror.  

## The four theories of sympathy
We can now see that applying the two earlier distinctions can shed light on what elements or relations are involved in Zaynab's sympathetic response. Is Zaynab's awareness mediated or not? Does it depend on the actual occurrence of what she feels or not? These questions make sense, and it is just not obvious what we should say in reply to each of them. 

SYMPATHY | Dependent | Independent
--- | --- | ---
Immediate | A: 'Naïve realist' | B: 'Intentionalist'
Mediate | C: Contagion | D: Simulation

## Diagnosis
This gives us the four most general theories of sympathy. We have theories that maintain that sympathising with another person's feeling is immediate, and theories that posit some mediator phenomenon. And we have theories that maintain that sympathising with another involves a merely intentional mode of awareness, and theories that deny this. Laying out the possibilities in this way allows us to make some observations.

### Bias towards contagion and simulation
Alvin Goldman writes about sympathy that it is a low-level mental simulation in which one mental process "is launched in an attempt to _match_ another one."[@goldman2009aa, p. 246, my italics] In recognizing another’s face as expressing a certain emotion, "the observer’s emotional system 'resonates' with that of the target, and this is the matching event on which the attribution is based" [@goldman2006aa, p. 132]. Similarly, Amy Coplan maintains that sympathising "the observer _replicates_ or _reconstructs_ the target's experiences", experiences not directly accessible through the observer's perception [@coplan2011aa, pp. 5-6, my italics]. 

It strikes me that the vast majority of authors that have recently discussed sympathy seem to assume that Zaynab's sympathy for Hisham must somehow be mediated by her own feeling. When Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, the feeling she's immediately aware of is a 'mirror image' of Hisham's anxiety. Sympathy, it is assumed, is at root a kind of 'replicating' or 'mirroring' of feeling, where this replication either is a low-level, automatic response, or the project of a more sophisticated, top-down mechanism of simulation or imagination. 

In other words, the current consensus among authors who assume that we have a sympathetic capacity is that sympathy either consists in a form of emotional contagion, or in a form of mental simulation. That sympathy is a mediated form of awareness seems currently 'beyond dispute'. We now see how this ignores two potentially viable options, the ones that parallel naïve realism and intentionalism in the philosophy of perception. Let's briefly turn to these. 

### The possibility of 'immediate sympathy'
Suppose that Hisham's anxiety is the immediate object of Zaynab's awareness. What Zaynab feels _is_ Hisham's fear. Here sympathy does not require her to have any feeling of her own. People who accept this may disagree among each other about whether Zaynab's awareness of Hisham's fear is merely intentional or not. But either way, both parties can agree that the traditional way of thinking about sympathy as a capacity to 'feel what others feel' is spot on.

The disappearance of these positions from the discussion is a recent one. When I talked about the history of the concept, I suggested that sympathy was introduced precisely to make possible a kind of immediate influence of one being on another. We find defenders of this understanding even in the early twentieth century. Around 1928, Alfred North Whitehead characterised sympathy as "feeling the feeling _in_ another and feeling conformally _with_ another" [@whitehead1979aa, p. 162]. He explicitly allows for feeling to be _shared_ between individuals, and this characterisation seems to capture both aspects of immediacy and dependence.

### Why this oversight?

Why is it that the idea of---quite literally---feeling what another feels, as Whitehead seems to suggest, sounds so odd to many philosophers or psychologists? I think this is primarily because it contradicts a 'modern' intuition about psychology.   

It is a commonplace that feelings are essentially subjective, private states of mind, only accessible to the person in which they originate. Much the same holds for mental states more generally, at least in so far they involve an occurrent affective or emotional component. Yet, should we really accept this? I want to suggest that the intuition is in conflict with the very phenomena that led Hume and others to hold onto the theory of sympathy.

In the _Treatise_, Hume struggles with this when he acknowledges the manifestly social form human feeling _can_ take. As he writes, 

> No quality of human nature is more remarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that propensity we have to sympathize with others, and to receive by communication their inclinations and sentiments, however different from, or even contrary to our own. (_Treatise_, §XI)

Hume's subsequent _theory_ of sympathy tries to harmonise such sympathetic responses with his general assumption that our consciousness strictly does not reach beyond the affections of our own mind. But just as most philosophers of perception have come to reject Hume's 'mediate' theory of sense impressions as the only possible account of our visual experience of our surroundings, perhaps there is reason to be dissatisfied with the narrowness of Hume's own theory of sympathy---a theory that still lies at the root of current discussions.

This at least reveals a tension. On the one hand, we still feel the pull of those everyday cases in which the suffering or rapture of others is communicated to us in an affective way. On the other hand, our tradition of psychological theorising does not admit of feeling to 'travel' or 'spread out' beyond the individual. But then, we should ask, what makes us so confident that feeling can't be shared? I suggest we at least aspire to move beyond our comfort zone, and comb through our background assumptions about feelings and other minds, instead of assuming that this issue was settled once and for all in the eighteenth century.

### Ethics of sympathy

Observing that there is this tension is relevant to discussions of the ethical standing of sympathy. In recent years several authors have worried about sympathy's validity and reliability: does it really track what it purports to, and can it ever succeed? 

Peter Goldie is a prominent critic. He spells out our capacity for sympathy in terms of imaginative perspective-shifting. Goldie thinks that when Zaynab sympathises with Hisham, Zaynab is imagining _being_ Hisham. In such an imaginative project, Zaynab becomes aware of imagined feelings that are ascribed to Hisham. Goldie's account entails that, strictly, it isn't Hisham's feeling Zaynab is aware of, but an imagined counterpart---indeed, a mediator. This is why Goldie feels compelled to conclude that Zaynab's sympathy is prone to distort Hisham's psychology considerably: there inevitably will be factors we leave out of such imaginative engagement, not insignificantly the fact that it matters that a feeling arose in _Hisham_, instead of in Zaynab's imagination [@goldie2011ac, p. 14; @goldie2005aa]. Trying to apprehend the one particular feeling by apprehending another feeling that's merely similar _necessarily_ falls short.

But if sympathy is understood as an immediate awareness of another person's mental state then Goldie's worry does not arise. Of course, it may be difficult to exercise our capacity for sympathy, just as it can be hard to exercise our capacity for sight---seeing the farm animals on a dim-lit country road after dusk may be hard to achieve. The point is that, if sympathy is a capacity for feeling someone else's feelings immediately, then it is at least in principle possible to succeed. 

This is one reason why the discussion over whether sympathising with others is mediated or not is relevant. If it's necessarily mediated by some feelings originating in us, then we have reason for ethical scepticism; but if it's not, then perhaps its one of the most valuable ways of directly relating to others we have.

# Conclusions

This is just the starting point of a discussion. Although historically, all four possible theories of sympathy received attention, I worry that nowadays philosophers start ordering their meals without having flipped the menu. I've tried to exploit an analogy with perception to bring out that sympathetic engagement may be theorised in more ways. More specifically, I suggested that we may want to try to develop an understanding of sympathy as a form of immediate awareness of the feelings of others.

I have not given a defence of that theory. My main point is that taking the full range of options into consideration, and reflecting more carefully on the arguments that speak in favour or against them, forces us to retrace our steps. This can have important ethical implications; it is likely to shed a brighter light on how we understand ourselves in relation to one another.
