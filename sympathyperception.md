abstract: Sympathy is often understood as the capacity to 'feel with' others. In this paper I want to approach a serious philosophical issue about this capacity through the lens of a fundamental dispute in the philosophy of perception. My aim is to bring out how it is all to easy to overlook viable options in the discussions about sympathy. In particular, I want to focus attention on why a 'direct' account of sympathy, one which allows us to feel the actual feelings of others, is commonly ruled out ab initio.

# Perception, moral sympathy, and episodic memory

Before concluding, it is insightful to compare the two schemas we have talked about so far with a third. Let's briefly turn to memory. 

Episodic memory is often thought of as a capacity for being affected by past events. This is often maintained even by people who think of memory as essentially _reconstructive_. There is a long dispute in the philosophy of memory over the question whether remembering a past event depends on the actual occurrence of that event or not. In a flash I may episodically recall an occasion on which I was bullied in high school. Does my having that memory episode right now depend on the remembered occasion's actually having taken place? 'Dependent' theories of memory claim it does, 'independent' theories deny that. 

As a further question, we may ask whether the episode I undergo now, when I remember the bullying, is the event we claim to remember, or some other event? If it's another event, then again it seems that we're dealing with some kind of go-between or proxy for the event that's the 'target' of the memory. And so again we can see a split between 'mediate' and 'immediate' theories of memory. 

MEMORY | Dependent | Independent

Immediate | A: ? | B: ?
Mediate | C: ? | D: ?

What is most interesting to observe here is that there is at least a prima facie plausibility to the Independent Mediator views in a way not found in perception. In remembering, we recreate an event that is not actually going on, but merely imagined, and this imagined event stands in and aims to track or represent an earlier event, the event we claim to remember. These views are called naive indirect realists about memory, and face the question: what distinguishes memory from imagination [cf. Lawlor's chapter in @mclaughlin2009aa, p. 663]. On the other hand, the idea that an actual event is experienced, which mediates for a past event (call it the re-enactment view), is puzzling as an account of episodic memory.
